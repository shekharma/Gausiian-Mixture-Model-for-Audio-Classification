## Overview
This repository contains code for implementing a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for audio classification using wavelet transform features. The GMM is trained to classify audio signals into predefined classes, making it useful for tasks such as speech recognition, environmental sound classification, and music genre classification.

### Introduction
The Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is a probabilistic model commonly used for clustering and classification tasks. In the context of audio classification, GMMs are particularly useful for modeling the distribution of feature vectors extracted from audio signals.

### Model Description
A GMM represents the probability distribution of the observed data as a weighted sum of multiple Gaussian distributions. Each Gaussian component represents a cluster in the feature space. The model assumes that the observed data is generated from a mixture of these Gaussian distributions.

Mathematically, the probability density function (PDF) of a GMM is given by:

\[ p(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \pi_k \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x} | \boldsymbol{\mu}_k, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_k) \]

Where:
- \( \mathbf{x} \) is the observed feature vector.
- \( K \) is the number of Gaussian components in the mixture.
- \( \pi_k \) is the weight associated with the \( k \)-th Gaussian component, representing its relative contribution to the mixture.
- \( \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x} | \boldsymbol{\mu}_k, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_k) \) is the multivariate Gaussian distribution with mean \( \boldsymbol{\mu}_k \) and covariance matrix \( \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_k \).

### Training
The parameters of a GMM, including the means, covariances, and mixture weights, are typically estimated from the training data using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The EM algorithm iteratively updates the parameters to maximize the likelihood of the observed data under the model.

During training, the GMM learns to represent the underlying distribution of feature vectors in the training data. Each Gaussian component captures a cluster of similar feature vectors, allowing the model to effectively capture the variability present in the data.

### Classification
Once trained, a GMM can be used for classification by computing the likelihood of a given feature vector under each Gaussian component. Classification is typically performed by assigning the feature vector to the component with the highest likelihood or by using techniques such as maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation.

In the context of audio classification, GMMs are applied to classify audio signals based on features extracted from the signals, wavelet transform coefficients.

### Conclusion
In summary, the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is a powerful probabilistic model for audio classification tasks. By modeling the distribution of feature vectors extracted from audio signals as a mixture of Gaussian distributions, GMMs can effectively capture the underlying structure of the data and provide accurate classification results.
